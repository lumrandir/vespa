Vespa is my homework for modelling. It describes storage upkeep depending on
order size and period.

For build just type 

  ghc Main.hs -o vespa --make

in your terminal. Of course you should have Glasgow haskell compiler for this purpose.
Then you can run it
  
  ./vespa

It'll give you two values - optimal order size and period - and will draw two graphics
in pdf. Search them under current directory.

Ingen ord mer.
